                        The coronavirus continues to pose a serious public health risk. Viruses constantly change, and new versions emerge. The Delta variant is now the most common strain of the coronavirus in the United States.You should know that:
                        
                        The Delta variant is more contagious, causes more infections, and spreads faster than the original virus.
                        The Delta variant may cause more severe illness than previous strains in unvaccinated people.
                        Although vaccines provide strong protection against severe disease and death, fully vaccinated people can be infected by and transmit the Delta variant.
